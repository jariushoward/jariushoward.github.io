        <h2>Oscar Smith</h2>
        <p>I played football all four years of high school, but my career didn't begin to take off until my junior season. After playing <abbr title="Running Back">RB</abbr> my entire life, my junior year, I decided to make the switch to <abbr title="wide receiver">WR</abbr>.</p>

        <p>I earned the Most Outstanding WR Award, which was the WR <abbr title="Most Valuable Player">MVP</abbr> Award for my team.

        <p>I earned All-District and All-Region WR honors making me one of the top players in the area at my position.</p>

        <p>By my senior year, I was ranked as the third best WR in the state of <abbr title="Virginia">VA</abbr> for the class of <time datetime="2019">2019</time>.
