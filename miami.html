      <h2>University of Miami</h2>
      <p>I enrolled at the University of Miami to begin my college football career <time datetime="2019-07">July 2019</time>. I redshirted my freshman season to focus on gaining weight and preparing my body for the collegiate level.</p>

      <p>In the spring of freshman year, preparing for my sophomore season, we all got sent home because of Covid-19.</p>

      <p>When we returned to school to prepare for the season, the first day of practice I suffered a career ending injury. I tore my ACL, PCL, LCL, and suffered nerve damage in my foot.</p>

      <p>I ended up having two surgeries, one to repair my knee and the other to fix the nerve in my foot. I had my surgeries two years apart.</p>
