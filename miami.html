        <h2>University of Miami</h2>
        <p>After graduating from high school in <time datetime="2019-06">June 2019</time>, two weeks later it was time for me to report to the University of Miami to begin my college football career. I redshirted my freshman year to focus on gaining weight and adjusting to the speed of the collegiate level.</p>

        <p>In the spring of my freshman year, <time datetime="2020-03">March 2020</time>, the entire team got sent home because of Covid-19 after only having three spring football practices.</p>

        <p>When we returned to school to prepare for the season, the first day of official practice, <time datetime="2020-08-07">August 7, 2020</time>, I suffered a career ending injury. I tore my <abbr title="Anterior Cruciate Ligament">ACL</abbr>, <abbr title="Posterior Cruciate Ligament">PCL</abbr>, <abbr title="Lateral Collateral Ligament">LCL</abbr>, and <abbr title="Posterolateral Corner">PLC</abbr> in my right knee. I also suffered nerve damage in my right foot.</p>

        <p>I ended up having to have two separate surgeries. One to repair my knee and the other to repair the nerve in my foot.</p>

        <p>My college football career was over before it even began. My football career may be over, but my life is just beginning. I graduate from the University of Miami on <time datetime="2022-12-16">December 16, 2022</time>.</p>
