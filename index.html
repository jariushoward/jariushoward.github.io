    <h1>Jarius Howard</h1>

    <p>I was born on July 24, 2001 in Portsmouth, Virginia. I have one brother, PJ Howard. My parents are Ardonia and Eldridge Howard. My mom was born and raised in Portsmouth, Virginia. My dad is from Savannah Georgia. My dad was in the military and was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, that's how he met my mom. They got married and have been married now for 37 years.</p>

    <h2>Elementary School</h2>

    <p>I began elementary school in 2005. I began the pre-k program at Churchland Primary and Intermediate School. At the time I was five-years-old. My mom was afraid they wouldn't let me in because I was technically too young, but I was also too advanced. They let me in anyways because they figured I could help the other kids who were a little behind.</p>

    <p>I attended Churchland Primary and Intermediate School for eight years. I began in pre-k and went all the way through sixth grade. In Portsmouth Public Schools sixth grade is considered elementary school.</p>

    <h2>Middle School</h2>

    <p>In my hometown there are three public middle schools:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Churchland Middle School</li>
      <li>Cradock Middle School</li>
      <li>Waters Middle School</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I attended Churchland Middle School for seventh and eighth grade. I was a member of our seventh grade middle basketball team. In Portsmouth they seperate middle school basketball teams by grade level so that more people have a chance to make the team. There was a team for seventh grade boys and a team for eighth grade boys. The same went for the girls. I played football in seventh grade for the Norfolk Saints, a local Pop Warner team.</p>

    <p>In eighth grade I played junior varsity basketball for I.C. Norcom High School. I played football in eighth grade for the Virginia Beach Mustangs, a local Pop Warner team.</p>

    <h2>High School</h2>

    <p>My freshman year and the first semester of my sophomore year I attended I.C. Norcom High School. I transferred the second semester of my sophomore year to Oscar Smith High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. I completed the remainder of high school career at Oscar Smith and earned my high school diploma.</p>

    <p>I played basketball my freshman year of high school, but gave it up to focus strictly on football. I played football all four years of my high school career.</p>

    <p>My football position was Wide Receiver. I was one of the top ranked wide receivers in the state of Virginia.</p>

    <h2>College</h2>

    <p>After high school I wanted to find the best college for me. I fell in love with the University of Miami the first time I visited and knew that I could come here even if I wasn't playing football. I also was blessed enough to be able to further my football career here at the collegiate level as well.</p>

    <p>My college football career hasn't gone as planned as I recently had to medically retire due to injury. I tore my ACL, PCL, LCL, and suffered nerve damage in my foot on the first day of fall football practice of my sophomore year in 2020. The injury happened August 7, 2020 and I had the surgery on August 17, 2020. They thought that the nerve in my foot would naturally heal on his own, but it never did leading to me having another surgery on May 10, 2022.</p>

    <p>I'm now a senior here at the University of Miami on track to graduate here in Fall December 2022. My major is Broadcast Journalism and one day I hope to be a sports analyst and a sports writer for ESPN.</p>
