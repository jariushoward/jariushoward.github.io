      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>My name is Jarius Howard. I was born on <time datetime="2001-07-24">July 24, 2001</time> in Portsmouth, <abbr title="Virginia">VA</abbr>. I am the second child of Ardonia and Eldridge Howard. I have one sibling, a brother, named PJ Howard. We are eight years apart.</p>

      <p>I grew up watching football. Since I was born, I would go to my older brother's games. Being around the game since a young age, I always knew that one day I wanted to play football. After months of begging my dad to let me play, he finally signed me up to play flag football for the Norfolk Saints, a pop warner organization.</p>

      <p>When I went to my first football practice in <time datetime="2005-08">August 2005</time> I was only five years old. At the conclusion of my first practice, my coaches asked my dad if they could move me up to Tiny-Mite tackle football because I was too advanced for flag. My dad gave them the okay and I officially became the youngest player on my team.</p>

      <p>I played for the Norfolk Saints from kindergarten to seventh grade. In eighth grade, instead of playing for the Norfolk Saints, I played for the Pop Warner organization, the Virginia Beach Mustangs. We finished the season fifth in the nation.</p>

      <p>At the conclusion of my last Pop Warner season, it was time for me to prepare for my high school football career.</p>
