      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>My name is Jarius Howard. I was born on <time datetiime="2001-07-24">July 24, 2001</time>. I was born and raised in Portsmouth, <abbr title="Virginia">VA</abbr>. I am the second child of Ardonia and Eldridge Howard. I have one sibling, a brother, named PJ Howard. We are eight years apart.</p>

      <p>I grew up watching football on <abbr title="television">TV</abbr> and in person. Since I was born, I would go to my older brother's football games. Being around the game so much, I always knew I wanted to play. I told my dad that I wanted to play and he first signed me up when I was five-years-old. He signed me up to play flag football for the Pop Warner organization, the Norfolk Saints.</p>

      <p>When I went to my first football practice in <time datetime="2005-08">August 2005</time>, the coaches said that I was too advanced for flag football and they moved me up to Tiny-Mite. I was the youngest on my team and I was playing tackle football.</p>

      <p>I played for the Norfolk Saints from kindergarten to seventh grade. In eighth grade, instead of playing for the Norfolk Saints, I played for the Pop Warner organization, the Virginia Beach Mustangs. We finished the season fifth in the nation.</p>

      <p>At the conclusion of my last Pop Warner season, it was time for me to prepare for my high school career.</p>
